# Installation

1. Add the package to your flutter dependencies in you `pubspec.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    dependencies:
        dialog_flowtter: ^0.1.1
    ```

2. Make sure you add your dialog_flow_auth.json to the `pubspec.yaml` assets:

   ```yaml
    flutter:
        uses-material-design: true
        assets:
            - assets/dialog_flow_auth.json
   ```

3. Add your DialogFlow Auth JSON to the `assets` folder and rename it to `dialog_flow_auth.json`
  
> You can change the name and Path of your JSON later in the code. Just make sure to use the same one in the `pubspec.yaml`
  
4. Get the packages from:

    ```shell
    flutter packages get
    ```

# How to use

## Detect intent

One of the core features of DialogFlow is to detect what a person is trying to say. You can do that by detecting an intent that you have defined in your [DialogFlow console](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/)

1. Create an instance of `DialogFlowtter` and set the `sessionId` that will be used to identify the current conversation of the user with DialogFlow.

  > It's _**highly**_ recommended that you use a different `sessionId` for every conversation that the user establishes with the Assistant
  
  ```dart
    final DialogFlowtter dialogFlowtter = DialogFlowtter(
      sessionId: "YOUR_SESSION_ID_HERE",
    );
  ```

  (OPTIONAL) Change the JSON path to the one you're using. This defaults to `assets/dialog_flow_auth.json`.

  ```dart
    DialogFlowtter(
      jsonPath: "YOUR_JSON_PATH_HERE",
    );
  ```

2. Create a `QueryInput` where you can specify what data you want to send to DialogFlow.

  ```dart
    final QueryInput queryInput = QueryInput(
      text: TextInput(
        text: "Hi. How are you?",
        languageCode: "en",
      ),
    );
  ```

3. Send your input to DialogFlow through the `detectIntent` function.

  ```dart
    DetectIntentResponse response = await dialogFlowtter.detectIntent(
      queryInput: queryInput,
    );
  ```

> You can check the code for more info on what info you can send and receive

### Be sure to dispose the instance when you're done using it

  ```dart
    dialogFlowtter.dispose();
  ```

## Change the project id

You can change the Project ID that `DialogFlowtter` will use to find your intents in DialogFlow.

1. Create an instance of `DialogFlowtter`

  ```dart
    final DialogFlowtter dialogFlowtter = DialogFlowtter();
  ```

2. Change the `projectId` prop of the instance;

  ```dart
    dialogFlowtter.projectId = "deimos-apps-0905";
  ```

- Pro tip. You can do the exact same thing as above with the special Dart's [cascade notation](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour#cascade-notation-).

  ```dart
    final DialogFlowtter dialogFlowtter = DialogFlowtter()..projectId = "deimos-apps-0905";
  ```

## Make authenticated http requests to your DialogFlow project

You can access the authenticated http client generated by the package by calling the `client` attribute in your instance.

Keep in mind that this can become `null` if you have disposed your instance before.

## Create your own authenticated http client

You can get an authenticated, auto refreshing http client with your custom json data if you call the static `DialogFlowtter.getClient(yourJson)` function.

Keep in mind that this only authenticates with json provided by Google.

Check [googleapis_auth](https://pub.dev/packages/googleapis_auth) for more info.

# Further considerations

The `DialogFlowtter` class is a [singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern), so you don't have to worry about multiple authentication flows being prompted every time you instanciate it.

The class creates an authenticated http client, with the credentials obtained from the DialogFlow Auth JSON, whenever you instanciate the class and saves it for later use.

## Memory leaks

Make sure to `dispose` your `DialogFlowtter` instance whenever you're done using it. This makes sure to close the authenticated http client and all its `StreamSubscription`s to avoid memory leaks.

## Too many models

We have coded almost every model that you may need to use when implementing this package so you don't have to work with annoying `Map<String, dynamic>` objects. Feel free to ask for any model that is missing to be added to the package.

> The models that were not coded are included as annoying `Map<String, dynamic>` and are tagged with the `//? Create model if necessary`.
